# This workflow builds a Java project with Gradle and caches / restores any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle
# Step "Setup Gradle" is used to configure Gradle for optimal use in GitHub Actions, including caching of downloaded dependencies.
